> the Web has become the most ubiquitous application platform ever, and yet by historical accident the only natively supported programming language for that platform is JavaScript!

# WebAssembly

> WebAssembly or wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.

# WebAssembly Architecture

- A stack machine, 4 types, 67 instructions
- Designed to support streaming compilation
- Simple validation rules
- Exports / imports functions
- Linear memory is shared with JavaScript

---

# WebAssembly Future

- Garbage collector
- Threads
- Host bindings
- SIMD
- Exception handling

# WebAssembly Language Support

# 2018

- Rust, C, C++ used in production for performance critical, algorithmic tasks

--
- Webpack

--
- Java, C#, Typescript lots of creative experiments / POCs

--
- Native node modules

--
- GC support

---
class: center, offtop

# 2019

- Host bindings, SIMD, threading, ...

--
- Java, C&#35; become production ready

--
- Another wave of mobile, desktop and server-side UI frameworks will re-target the web
  - write once, run everywhere

--
- Performance gains fail to materialise, with backlash from early adopters

--
- Heavyweight productivity tools start moving to the web (e.g. Photoshop, AutoCAD)

---
class: center, offtop

# 2020 - and beyond

- JavaScript will compile directly to WebAssembly, `"use wasm"`

--
- Native Android apps die-out in favour of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) running on WebAssembly

--
- Windows store moves to PWA / WASM

--
- A new DOM alternative will emerge?

--
- JavaScript's monopoly will be lost, and it's popularity will fade

--
- The ubiquity of the web extends further still
