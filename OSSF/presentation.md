# The rise of automation

class: motif1,  motif-pos-bottom-right

# Why do we use DevOps? 

--
 - Reproducibility - through configuration as code, infrastructure as code
  - Reduction of defects
  - Release with confidence

--
 - Speed - through test automation, rapid deployment
  - Reduced time to market

--
 - Agility
  - Ability to try new ideas quickly, MVPs

--
 - Collaboration
  - Faster resolution of issues

class: motif9 motif-pos-bottom-right

# Does automation ensure a quality product?

--
  - *of course not!*

--
  - you hire people who are technically able

--
  - ... their behaviour is influenced by the culture

--
  - ... imparted through company and project on-boarding

--
### *but in open source, this cultural element is lost, or at least harder to build*

# Cultural challenges of open source

--
 - you're working with:

--
 - ... distributed team

--
 - ... a fluid and ever changing team

--
 - ... people with different levels of technical skills, communication skills

--
 - ... people with different needs, goals and ambitions

 - Azer Ko√ßulu withdrew 250 packages from npm, including `left-pad`
 - This package was downloaded 2.5m per month
 - Broke Babel, React, ... everything!

# Cultural challenges of open source

 - you're working with:
 - ... distributed team
 - ... a fluid and ever changing team
 - ... people with different levels of technical skills, communication skills
 - ... people with different needs, goals and ambitions

## *What do these people need?*

---
class: motif7 motif-pos-bottom-right

# As a (potential) contributor, what are my needs?

--
  - Understand the goals of the project

--
  - Rapidly clone and build locally
  <!-- lots of tools, docker, package managers -->

--
  - Test and verify my changes
  <!-- CI / unit test -->

--
  - I don't want to spend lots of time reading about code style, naming conventions, etc ...
  <!-- prettier, husky -->

--
  - I want rapid feedback on my pull requests and issues
  <!-- probot -->

---
class: motif4 motif-pos-bottom-right

# As a maintainer, what are my needs?

--
  - Baseline - the same as any other contributor

--
  - Easy to release
  <!-- CI, semantic-release -->

--
  - Communicate with, and grow, my community

--
  - Enforce my license requirements
  <!-- cla-bot -->

--
  - Manage dependencies, their licences and vulnerabilities
  <!-- GitHub, licence-checker, greenkeeper -->

# I want to easily test and verify my changes

--
## Continuous Integration (CI)

--
 - This is your backbone 
  - Doesn't do anything by itself, it's just a trigger 

--
 - Run Unit tests (standard hygiene!)
  - gives confidence to both contributors and maintainers

---
class: motif2 motif-pos-bottom-right

# I want to rapidly clone and build locally

--
 - Use tools to manage dependencies
  - npm, crates.io, CocoaPods

--
 - Ensure your project is OS agnostic (enforce using CI)

--
 - Consider docker

--
 - Typically enforced by static analysis, and supported by editor configuration

--
  - doesn't support multiple editors
  - catches the problem late on
  - some linters have a fix mode, but not all

![](assets/prettier.png)

> By far the biggest reason for adopting Prettier is to stop all the on-going debates over styles.

--
 - reformats *everything* JS => AST => JS
 - opinionated, it is not intended to be configured
 - can be run in CI and editor

# I want rapid feedback on issues

--
 - this can be quite challenging!

  - could be a hobby project that you don't have that much time for
  - or, you might be Facebook or Microsoft!

---

![](assets/probot.png)

---

![](assets/probot-info.png)

--
 - Why not use this tool to welcome new users?
 - Perhaps highlight your Code of Conduct?

---

![](assets/probot-welcome.png)

--
 - Maybe set expectations around review timings?

# Releases are complex

 - Deployment to servers (if running as a service)
 - Releasing packages to repositories / CDNs
 - Closing issues, tagging, branch twiddling
 - Version number increments
 - Communication of changes
 - ...

# semantic release

  - Commit messages dictate the version number
  - Repo tagged
  - Release notes generated
  - New packages deployed
  - Allows Continuous Deployment of libraries / frameworks

# Manage dependencies, licences and vulnerabilities

 - Are my dependencies up to date?
 - Have there been any disclosed vulnerabilities that affect me?
 - Have I violated any of the licence terms in my dependencies?

# I want enforce my licence requirements

--
  - Ensure the contributor is authorised to submit the work
  - Ensure that the project can distribute the work

--
  - CLA - Contributor Licence Agreement
  - DCO - Developer Certificate of Origin

--
  - Both require significant overhead
  - With FINOS there wasn't an existing mechanism that worked

# Wrap up!

--
 - Use automation to make life easier for contributors and maintainers
   - there are lots of tools out there!
   - make your project more welcoming to contributors
   - reduce your maintenance overhead
   - allow you both to focus on the problem

--
 - If a suitable tool doesn't exist, build it!

--
 - Final thoughts ...
   - Open source software is built by people
   - Tools like Slack, Skype, Hangouts help build a community and create a culture
