# A brief history of app development

## (and the move to Open Source)

---
class: vertical-top

# Desktop Era

--
- Dominated by
  - Microsoft - WinForms
  - Sun - Java Swing

--
- Single-vendor solutions

--
- Web was primarily for server-side rendered content

---
class: vertical-top

# RIA Era

--
- Flex, Silverlight, plugins used for LOB apps

--
- Microsoft replacing WinForms with WPF

--
- HTML5 in its infancy, pushed by Google

---
class: vertical-top

# HTML5 Era

--
- Plugins are dead (thanks Steve Jobs!)
  - HTML5 everywhere, web, desktop, mobile, watch

--
- The pace of change has been considerable
  - but at a cost, HTML5 is nebulous, ill-defined, complicated, confusing
  - lacks a single owner

--
- HTML5 is maturing
  - and is becoming tangibly better ...

# Hot Module Reload

 - Refactor UI into new components
 - Update presentation logic
 - Change formatting logic
 - Update business logic
 - Fix issues with wiring up state to the view

---

# But what about state changes?

(desktop demo time)

---

# Hot Module Reload + Time Travel

- Refactor UI into new components
- Update presentation logic
- Change formatting logic
- Update business logic
- Fix issues with wiring up state to the view
- ...
- If your app reaches an invalid state, back-up
- Replay actions after fixing issues
- Store a log of actions
- And much more ...

# And it works on mobile too!

# Lessons learnt

---
class: middle

## Single-vendor solutions

## vs.

## Open Source Software, which is built by a large community



---
class: middle

## Collaboration is the key

---
class: vertical-top

# Joining the community

--
- Use open source frameworks, products, libraries

--
- Contribute, raise issues, fix bugs, improve documentation
 - Your contribution can become your security

--
- Open source your code
 - But understand that there is so much more to it than just putting your code on GitHub!
