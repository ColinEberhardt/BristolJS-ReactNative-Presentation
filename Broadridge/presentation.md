> any application that **can** be written in JavaScript, **will** eventually be written in JavaScript

Atwood's Law, 2007

<!--
 - it is an amusing twist on the 'principle of least power'
 - a w3c document that proposes using simple langauges, and data formats, over more complex ones
 - Jeff is mocking the simplicity of JavaScript, it is the least powerful language, hence we'll all by JS in the future!

# My app can be written in JavaScript - but why should I write it in JavaScript?

<!--
 - Nowadays JS runs everywhere, it's a given that you can write in JS
 - but should you?
 - In many cases, whether silverlight, flash, you're been forced to
 - there are good reasons

# Developer Productivity

<!--
 - often quoted book,
 - central theme, adding more dev resource to a late project, simply makes it later
 - I'll leave the big thinking to others, instead I want to focus on something much simpler

<!--
 - I want to look at the development cycle
 - that think we do over and over again each day
 - the smaller the cycle, the smaller the unit of change, and the faster we become.

#ReactJS

- ReactJS is 'functional'
 - The view is a pure function of its properties and state
 - The entire view is re-rendered on change

--
- The view is rendered to a virtual DOM
- A 'diffing' process is used to update the real DOM

--
- Separation of concerns (not technologies)

--
- Inline styles are arguably a good thing
  - "CSS in your JS" - [Christopher Chedeau](https://vimeo.com/116209150)

--
- Performance?
 - Is ReactJS Fast? - [Boris Dinkevich](http://blog.500tech.com/is-reactjs-fast/)

# ReactJS enforces a unidirectional flow of changes

# What's cool about React is the concept, not the implementation

---

# But what about state changes?

(demo time)

---

# Hot Module Reload + Time Travel

- Refactor UI into new components
- Update presentation logic
- Change formatting logic
- Update business logic
- Fix issues with wiring up state to the view
- ...
- If your app reaches an invalid state, back-up
- Replay actions after fixing issues
- Store a log of actions
- And much more ...
